I'm a programmer that's highly interested in everything computers—from hardware to software.
While my traditional education was the foundation for my skills in several programming languages, the foundation for my interest in computers started much earlier.
Other than programming, I also have several self-taught digital skills such as image editing, video editing, audio editing, server hosting, and something that I spend a lot of free time doing—3D level design for games.
